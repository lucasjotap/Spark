This is my main file for keeping the stuff I learned about Apache Spark and its functionalities.


`What is Spark?`
Spark has been around for a number of years but continues to gain in popularity and use cases. Many new projects within the Spark ecosystem continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible with the system. For example, a new high-level streaming engine, Structured Streaming, was introduced in 2016. This technology is a hugepart of companies solving massive-scale data challenges, from technology companies like Uber and Netflix using Spark’s streaming and machine learning tools, to institutions like NASA, CERN, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard applying Spark to scientific data analysis.
